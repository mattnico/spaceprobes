                <a href="http://arielwaldman.com">Ariel Waldman</a> is a human in orbit of San Francisco on a mission to create "massively multiplayer science". Waldman has traveled vast distances as part of her mission, performing flybys of Colombia, China, Kenya, Madagascar, Mexico and South Africa. The human has performed an array of operations on her journey through the solar system, including founding Spacehack.org, directing Science Hack Day, advising NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts program, and co-authoring NRC’s future of human spaceflight report. Earthlings can continue to support this human’s extended mission on Patreon.

                <a href="http://twitter.com/basilleaf">Lisa Ballard</a> is a human that launched from California and maintains an orbit around the East Bay. Ballard was sent on a mission to make planetary data accessible and support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The human regularly sends signals to the Rings Node Planetary Data System at the SETI Institute, Spacehack.org and Seahack.org. Ballard’s voyage across the solar system has traversed the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the peaks of Mount Diablo. Wherever Ballard goes, she carries her trusty scuba gear, hiking supplies, cats and yoga mat for performing surveys of the planet’s landscape.
