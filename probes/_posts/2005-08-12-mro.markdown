The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose space probe in the orbit of Mars that is providing detailed observations of the planet, identifying potential landing sites for future missions, and acting as a communications relay for other Martian space probes. Equipped with a powerful telescopic camera, MRO is able to image surface features as small as a kitchen table while making a complete orbit of Mars every 112 minutes. These observations are used to investigate where water may have once flowed on Mars for long enough to support a habitat for life. MRO also monitors the climate of Mars year-round, reporting on changes in its atmosphere and weather. Using its
