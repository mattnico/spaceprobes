The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) space probe is orbiting Mars to learn more about the planet's upper atmosphere. Its eliptical orbit allows for the space probe to pass through the upper atmosphere of Mars and take samples of various molecules. When MAVEN is above the atmosphere, it will conduct ultraviolet imaging of the planet. By sampling and imaging the upper atmosphere, scientists expect to be able to learn more about the history of the Martian climate and habitability for life.
