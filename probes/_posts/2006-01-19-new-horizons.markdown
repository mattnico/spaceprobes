New Horizons is a space probe launched by NASA on 19 January 2006 to study the dwarf
planet Pluto and the Kuiper belt. It is expected to be the first spacecraft to fly by
and study Pluto and its moons, Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx, with an estimated
arrival date at the Pluto–Charon system of 14 July 2015. As of 27 February 2014, its distance
from Pluto is about 4.00 AU or 598,000,000 km (about 29.28 AU or 4.380×109 km from Earth), with
radio signals taking approximately 4 hours to travel to the spacecraft from Earth (an 8 hour round trip).
