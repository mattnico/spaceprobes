The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), informally referred to as Mangalyaan, is India's first interplanetary space probe. Mangalyaan aims to demonstrate the technologies needed for the country's flagship interplanetary mission. During its orbit of Mars over six to ten months, the space probe will also conduct surveys of the Martian surface, mineral composition and atmosphere. India is the fourth space agency to have a space probe successfully reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA and the European Space Agency.
