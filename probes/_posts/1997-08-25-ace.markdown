ACE, short for the Advanced Composition Explorer, is a space probe on a mission to study particles from the Sun, our solar system, other stars and our galaxy. By observing these particles, ACE hopes to learn more about the formation and evolution of our solar system. ACE is able to report on solar wind activity (the stream of highly ionized gas the Sun blows out) in near-real-time, providing an early warning to Earth on when  intense solar storms are headed our way that could disrupt satellite communications, overload power grids or pose hazards to astronauts. The space probe is expected to have enough propellant to operate until 2024.
