Juno is a space probe currently on its way to arrive at Jupiter in 2016. Juno will study Jupiter's origin, interior, atmosphere and <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=1589">magnetosphere</a>. Notably, the space probe will be gathering clues as to what the inside of Jupiter is made up of â€“ whether it has a solid core and how much water is present in its atmosphere. Juno will also directly sample the charged particles that make up planet's auroras, while simultaneously observing them in ultraviolet.
