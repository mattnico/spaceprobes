Voyager 2 is a 722-kilogram (1,592 lb) space probe launched by NASA on August 20, 1977 to
study the outer Solar System. Operating for 36 years, 7 months and 27 days as of 2 May 2014,
the spacecraft communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return
data. At a distance of about from the Earth as of 2 May 2014, it is the farthest human-made object from Earth.
Blah blah blah.
