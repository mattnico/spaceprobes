MESSENGER (short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is the first space probe to orbit Mercury. The space probe traveled 8 billion km, including 15 trips around the Sun, one flyby of Earth, two flybys of Venus, and three flybys of Mercury, before reaching its orbit. MESSENGER is investigating Mercury's surface, atmosphere and magnetic field to learn more about how the planet evolved over time. Data from the space probe revealed that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity and confirmed the presence of water ice in the shadows of craters.
