Chang'e 3 is China's first space probe on the surface of the Moon. Chang'e 3 consists of a lander and a rover named Yutu ("Jade Rabbit"). In 2013, Chang'e 3 became the first space probe to "soft land" on the Moon since 1976. The space probe's mission is to demonstrate technologies for future Moon missions, conduct astronomical observations and survey the lunar environment. After several days on the Moon, the Yutu rover became immobile and was not able to carry out all commands, possibly due to frostbite. The Chang'e 3 lander frequently goes into hibernation but continues to emerge occasionally to talk to Earth.
